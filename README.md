## Motivation

In my previous job at Arts Council England, I was frustrated by the way people often talked about making art more inclusive, but wrote about it in a way you needed a PhD to understand. This project began as a way to make an app to art galleries more accessible, by translating the often difficult language printed on the walls into something most people could understand.

This project is in a very early stage - it currently can only be run as a script, but it does function as a programme for extracting text from images and translating it into plain English. The original idea was to make this functionality part of a mobile app, to allow users to scan the text with their camera. I may return to this in future, but given that the same effect is now achievable using the Claude, ChatGPT etc. mobile apps, there may not be a sufficiently distinctive use case for such a product.
